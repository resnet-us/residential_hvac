# Comparing HVAC modeling methodologies

Comparing methods of modeling air conditioners and heat pumps.

## Components

1. COP at rated conditions from seasonal rating (SEER or HSPF)
2. C_D and part load degredation
4. Total capacity at off-rated conditions
5. Sensible capacity at off-rated conditions (still needed)
6. COP at off-rated conditions
